            <p> I attended St. Peter's College Dunboyne, in County Meath, Ireland for Secondary School (High School).</p>
            <p> I was an accomplished academic student, leaving the school with Leaving Certificate results in the top 5% of the country. </p>
            <p> I was also nominated for the Maths and Science and Academic Achievment awards. </p>
            <p> While at secondary school I developed my love of Mathematics and Science, and my interest in acting. </p>

            <p> My home university is Maynooth University, where I am a student of Computational Thinking.</p>

            <p> I recieved an entrance scholarship into Maynooth due to my Leaving Certificate results, and I am on course to receive a 1:1 degree. </p>

            <p> I am currently studying abroad at Fordham University in NYC as part of Maynooth's Study Abroad Exchange Program.</p>
            <p> I am free to take whatever classes I choose, so I have taken this as an opportunity to take classes in subjects I find challenging and interesting.</p>
            <p> I am taking classes in Digital Design, Web Design, Physics, Economics, English, Computational Physics and Acting.</p>
            <p> This year has helped me to grow into a more well rounded and mature individual through putting me out of my comfort zone. </p>
